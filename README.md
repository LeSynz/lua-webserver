# Lua Webserver

A simple webserver built with Lua as part of my journey to learn new languages by creating basic todo webservers in each.

## Goals

- Learn Lua fundamentals
- Build a minimal webserver
- Implement basic todo CRUD functionality

## Features

- Serve HTTP requests
- Add, view, update, and delete todo items
- Lightweight and easy to understand

## Getting Started

    Download and install Lua from [lua.org](https://www.lua.org/).

2. **Clone this repository**
